I collect and organize my videos and notebooks into this repo so there is a structured path for learning AI / LM research.

[Back to GitHub Course Home](ub.com/vukrosic/ultimate-ai-research-and-engineering-course)

I will build this in public so you can help me figure out what this should be like.

## In 1-2 years:

We should be able to break records on [fastest GPT-2 pretraining](https://github.com/KellerJordan/modded-nanogpt/) and similar challenges, as well as implement our own challenges like speedrunning Llama, Gemma, Qwen small pretraining etc.

Another idea could be to reproduce GPT-3.5 as open source eventually.

I will keep publishing videos on [my YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7XJj9pv_11a11FUxCMz15g).

In the beginning we will focus on fundamentals, for example - implementing backpropagation and neural network form scratch.

Mastering fundamentals is a lot more important than reading all the latest papers and companies want you to do this.

I am looking for your feedback here and on YouTube.


**Ilya Sutskever:**
1. I found that if I read something very slowly, I will eventually uderstand it.
2. Coming up with new ideas is modest, it’s more imprtant to understand the results, existing ideas and what’s going on. Main activity is understanding.

Reading new papers & ideas is cool but progress mostly comes from deeply understanding current ones.


## Why Open Source

Future of AI & humanity should not be locked behind paywalls, APIs, or corporate vaults.

Big companies can build products, serve customers, and innovate — that’s their role, but the future must be shaped in the open and by everybody.

I believe you — the curious coder, the student with a second-hand laptop, the researcher with no access to H100s — will help build & direct the most powerful technology in human history.

We don’t need billion-dollar clusters — we need brilliant minds across MIT, Tsinghua, random cafes, and Discord channels.

By the people, for the people.

- 🤝 Help others
- 📺 Read, watch, learn
- 🧑‍💻 Fork the code
- 📈 Beat the benchmarks
- 🌍 Make AI open


## Opinion: Alignment Through Transparency

Safety in AI comes from exposure. Only through open code, open evaluations, and public scrutiny can we ensure that AI systems are robust, fair, and aligned with everybody.

Openness accelerates innovation, invites scrutiny, and ensures that knowledge does not become a weapon of the elite.
